[{"categories":null,"contents":"A Cloud native multi-package registry.\nEnseada is a modern, fast and scalable package registry, designed from the ground up to run in elastic, container-based environments and to be highly available and distributed.\n It leverages scalability by using natively distributed technologies\nThe registry itself is written in Go, a statically typed and extremely fast programming language very popular in Cloud native applications.\nCouchDB is used as the primary datastore, containing information about repositories, users and access control. CouchDB is a web-native database written in Erlang and based on web technologies like HTTP and JSON.\nAs far as storage is concerned, both local disks an object storage services are supported altough the latter are strongly recommended for production deployments.\nSecurity first Enseada aims at providing a small, yet complete set of feature for managing software packages. Security is a priority concern, so an advanced policy engine provides the capabilities to define fine grained permissions over repositories and packages. From human users to automated service accounts, every access to the system is controlled, filtered and logged. A fully compliant OAuth 2 implementation allows integration with third party systems with ease.\nManagement API A set of Twirp APIs allows to programmatically interact with Enseada and its resources. Check the documentation for more information.\nManagement UI The same set of functionalities exposed in the API is available as a built-in web GUI. Check the documentation for more information.\nSupported package repositories Enseada is a multi-package registry, meaning it can support a large number of package formats and registry APIs.\nAt the moment, the following formats are supported:\n Maven 2 / 3 NPM (planned, coming soon) Docker (planned, coming soon) RubyGems (planned, coming soon)  Supported storage providers Enseada abstracts the underlying storage provider with an agnostic engine based on ChartMuseum's library See Configuration for how to setup the storage layer.\nAt the moment, only these providers are supported:\n Local disk S3 compatible (AWS S3, Minio, DigitalOcean Spaces, Scaleway Object Storage, Ceph, etc) Google Cloud Storage  Local disk is only supported in single-node mode. To support cluster mode use an object storage provider.\nCluster mode Coming soon\n","permalink":"/about/","tags":null,"title":"About Enseada"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"/","tags":null,"title":"Enseada"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"/","tags":null,"title":"Enseada"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"/categories/","tags":null,"title":"Categories"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"/tags/","tags":null,"title":"Tags"}]
