[{"categories":null,"contents":"A Cloud native multi-package registry.\nEnseada is a modern, fast and scalable package registry, designed from the ground up to run in elastic, container-based environments and to be highly available and distributed.\n It leverages scalability by using natively distributed technologies\nThe registry itself is written in Rust, a statically typed and extremely fast programming language built for correctness and safety.\nCouchDB is used as the primary datastore, containing information about repositories, users and access control. CouchDB is a web-native database written in Erlang and based on web technologies like HTTP and JSON.\nPackages are can be stored in CouchDB itself, as file attachments, or in distributed object storage services like Amazon S3. The latter are recommended for production usage.\nSecurity first Enseada aims at providing a small, yet complete set of feature for managing software packages. Security is a priority concern, so an advanced policy engine provides the capabilities to define fine grained permissions over repositories and packages. From human users to automated service accounts, every access to the system is controlled, filtered and logged. A fully compliant OAuth 2 implementation allows integration with third party systems with ease.\nManagement API A set of RESTful APIs allows to programmatically interact with Enseada and its resources. Check the documentation for more information.\nManagement UI The same set of functionalities exposed in the API is available as a built-in web GUI. Check the documentation for more information.\nSupported package repositories Enseada is a multi-package registry, meaning it can support a large number of package formats and registry APIs.\nAt the moment, the following formats are supported:\n Docker Maven 2/3 NPM (planned, coming soon) RubyGems (planned, coming soon) Rust crates (planned, coming soon) Go module proxy (planned, coming soon)  Supported storage providers Enseada abstracts the underlying storage provider with a custom storage engine tailored for its use cases.\nAt the moment, the following providers are supported:\n CouchDB File Attachments S3 compatible (AWS S3, Minio, DigitalOcean Spaces, Scaleway Object Storage, Ceph, etc)  ","permalink":"/about/","tags":null,"title":"About Enseada"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"/","tags":null,"title":"Enseada"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"/","tags":null,"title":"Enseada"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"/categories/","tags":null,"title":"Categories"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"/tags/","tags":null,"title":"Tags"}]
